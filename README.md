## DESCRIPTION 
With the present data, we could analyze and predict the patterns of COVID-19, how it spreads and how it affects other factors and measures we can take. Using various enrichment datasets, we could study how COVID-19. We will present our findings in a report and in code. Here we are trying to provide insights on how to respond to the spread of COVID with the help of this project.
